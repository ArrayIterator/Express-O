# MIDDLEWARES DIRECTORY

This directory contains all the middlewares used in the application.

This folder maybe should contains 3 environments : `development`, `production` and `test`.

```text

├── development/ (development environment)
│   └── xxx.js (middleware file)
├── production/ (production environment)
│   └── xxx.js (middleware file)
└── test/ (test environment)
    └── xxx.js (middleware file)
```
