# ENTITIES DIRECTORY

This directory contains all the entities of the application. An entity is a class that represents a table in the database. It is used to interact with the database.

This folder maybe should contains 3 environments : `development`, `production` and `test`.

```text
entities/
├── development/ (development environment)
│   └── xxx.js (entity file)
├── production/ (production environment)
│   └── xxx.js (entity file)
└── test/ (test environment)
    └── xxx.js (entity file)
```
