# SEEDERS DIRECTORY

This directory contains your database seeders. Seed files are a great way to populate your database with sample data.

This folder maybe should contains 3 environments : `development`, `production` and `test`.

```text
views/
├── development/ (development environment)
│   └── xxx.js (seed file)
├── production/ (production environment)
│   └── xxx.js (seed file)
└── test/ (test environment)
    └── xxx.js (seed file)
```
