# MODELS DIRECTORY

Models for database tables are stored here. Each model is a class that inherits from the `db.Model` class. The `db.Model` class is a class provided by the `Flask-SQLAlchemy` extension. It is a base class for all models in the application. It is a configured declarative base class that includes SQLAlchemy ORM functionality.
