# STORAGE DIRECTORY

The storage directory for storing files storage.

The storage directory can be overridden by config environment `directory.storage` in [environment.yaml](../app/configs/environment.example.yaml)

This storage directory should store compiled `.tsx` / react compiled files on `react-engines` directory.

In other words, the `storage/react-engines` as a cached directory for storing compiled react.js files.
